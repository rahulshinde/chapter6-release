					<span class="bold">HOW TO BE THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF:</span>This manifesto explores our understanding of how to be the best version of yourself based on practicing activities together that we both identified as promoting holistic health including meditation, swimming, walking, communal meals, sharing creative ideas and collaborating on creative projects. These practices resulted in a mutually supportive relationship with one another emotionally and creatively. The goal of this chapter is to extend what we learned in hopes that we will be able to help you become the best version of you.

					Stay away from and choose not to be a part of the systems set in place that keep us separated, divided and that do not promote holistic health. Feeding into these distractions will only hold you back from being able to celebrate the characteristics and the people that make you a unique individual. These distractions act like advertisements that attempt to brainwash us into believing that we must fight against each other instead of learning about the experiences that we have to share; experiences we can use to inspire one another. The more beauty we are able to see in ourselves, the more beauty we will be able to see in one another. This results in a more powerful exchange of support and appreciation.
