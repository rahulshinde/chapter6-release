					<span class="bold">A NOTE FROM THE PRESS PRESS TEAM:</span>Over the past two years that the Press Press team has been in residence at the Catonsville site of Baltimore City Community College Refugee Youth Project, we have had the pleasure to collaborate with and learn from the many young writers and artists of the program. During our stay, we’ve been able to publish a range of works together and investigate various themes pertaining to our young writers’ lives, many of which have roots in Myanmar. The multi-cultural space we built, which is made up of entirely second-language speakers (all of the Press Press facilitators present are also second-language English speakers), attempts to combat traditional classroom power dynamics by creating a situation where each member of the group is both a facilitator and a learner. As group members, we are supportive of each individual’s way of expression, rather than assimilating into accepted American-English speaking models. We believe that the artwork we produce exists within the time and experiences we have together, rather than singularly existing in our published written works.
					<br>
					<br>
					In our on-going conversations, similar themes reemerge, such as our hopes for the places that we come from, as well as our hopes for Baltimore, for our families and friends. In reaction to these on-going conversations, we attempted to thoroughly investigate what our ideal, collective world would look like in a three-month intensive writing retreat that took inspiration from the prompt If I Ruled The World. In an interview with Dan Paz (Shifter Magazine, Issue Nr. 20) Tania Bruguera notes, “Education is the moment when you know yourself as a social being, of the inescapable situation of your role to come as part of society.” Inspired by this mode of thinking, and while witnessing a historic moment in Burma’s evolution into, what we hope will be, a truly democratic nation, our conversations were constantly shifting between real-time happenings, our futuristic aspirations and our roles as active beings in the world we envision. 
					<br>
					<br>
					The following page includes a timeline of the conversations we had as events in Burma unfolded and selection of writings that group members produced. We hope you are able to share in some of our experiences together through this collection of works.

					A BRIEF HISTORY OF MYANMAR
				</h1>

				<p class="history">
					Myanmar, also known as Burma, is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia that is bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. After three Anglo-Burmese wars over a period of 60 years, the British completed their colonization of the country in 1886 and administered it as a province of India. The British government ruled primarily among the Burman populations, and had less involvement in the affairs of the rural ethnic minority groups. This disproportionate control of power deepened the existing divisions between the Burman population and the minority groups, which include Karen, Chin and Rakhine.
					<br>
					<br>
					In the beginning of World War II, Aung San, a student activist, and 29 others, known as the Thirty Comrades, fought alongside the Japanese who invaded Burma to overthrow the British rule. However, Japan did not follow through with the promise of returning Burma to it’s people and Aung San negotiated with the British to push the Japanese back out of the country. After years of Aung San’s work towards independence and after his assassination, Burma was finally granted independence on January 4, 1948. Unfortunately, Burma still struggled to establish a democratic government as it was challenged by a civil war that was lead by communist and ethnic groups.
					<br>
					<br>
					General Ne Win, one of the Thirty Comrades, staged a coup which allowed his new Revolutionary Council to suspend the constitution and institute an authoritarian military rule. By replacing the parliament with a military dictatorship, jailing opponents of his party and cutting off contact with the outside world, Ne Win established a one-party country, heightened tensions between ethnic groups and eventually completely drained the nation’s economy. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Since the initial years that Ne Win took power in 1962, there were many sporadic protests against the military ruled government that were brutally suppressed. However, in 1988 demonstrations broke out across the country in, what was known as, the 8888 Uprising. 
					<br>
					<br>
					This uprising was started by students in Rangoon and was motivated by a frustration with the military rule, police brutality, economic mismanagement and complete corruption within the government. On July 23, Ne Win announced his resignation of BSPP party chairman and warned civilians, that “When the army shoots, it shoots to kill.” Protests continued to escalate until August 8th, when troops began a four day massacre, firing into crowds of civilians, from monks, young children, students, doctors and housewives, killing thousands. At least 10,000 demonstrators were killed across the country, although Burmese authorities only formally acknowledge 350. 
					<br>
					<br>
					After giving a speech urging civilians to find peace through non-violent ways in front of a crowd of 500,000 at the Shwedagon Pagoda on August 26th, Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, became a symbol of the struggle for democracy in the nation. When she returned to Burma, Aung San founded the National League for Democracy (NLD) and this summer became known as the Democracy Summer. However, on September 18th, 1988, control of the country was handed to a 19-member State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Only a few months later, on July of 1989, Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest for “endangering the state.”
					<br>
					<br>
					On May 27, 1990 Suu Kyi’s NLD party swept to victory with 82% of the vote of multi-party election but SLORC refused to acknowledge the election results and has retained its repressive grip on power. Aung San Suu Kyi remained under house arrest for almost 15 years, from July 20th, 1989, until her most recent release on November 13th, 2010. Due to all of these years of heavily militarized rule, close to half-a-million Burmese people have fled their country of origin. Most refugees reside in neighboring or nearby countries and approximately 98,000 live in the U.S. 
					<br>
					<br>
					On November 13th, 2015, the NLD secured the required two-thirds of the contested seats in parliament to win a majority. Burma is looking forward to upcoming presidential election and its way towards a peaceful and authentic democracy.

					ABOUT AUNG SAN SUU KYI: 
				</h1>

				<p class="history2">
					Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize awardee, is a Burmese opposition politician and chairperson of the National League for Democracy (NLD) in Myanmar. Inspired by the non-violent campaigns of US civil rights leader Martin Luther King and India’s Mahatma Gandhi, she organized rallies and travelled around the country, calling for peaceful democratic reform and free elections. During her 15 years of house arrest, from July 20th, 1989 to November 13th, 2010, Aung became one of the world’s most well known political prisoners and was nicknamed “the Lady.” In a historic moment for Myanmar, on November 13th, 2015, the NLD secured the required two-thirds of the contested seats in parliament to win a majority and are working towards establishing a true and authentic democracy for Myanmar.

						If I rule the world, there would be peace.

						There will always be plenty of food so that no one

						It would be poverty-free because it breaks my heart to <br>

						It would be safe for everyone. 
						<br>
						There wouldn’t be a big difference between social classes because I don’t like seeing poor people. 
						<br>
						There wouldn’t be bad things or bad people who influence good people to follow their foot step. 
						<br>
						I would influence every person to do good, be happy, be loving, be considerate, be kind, be helpful, be trustworthy, be caring, and all the good qualities.
						<br>
						I would enforce laws that doesn’t allow violence, drug, and other bad things people do today.
